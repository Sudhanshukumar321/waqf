    I strongly support the Waqf Amendment Bill. Waqf violates fundamental rights of local people of india.
    If adopted, this bill will transfer a majority of the control of Waqf properties to the government and their real land owners.
    Such boards erodes public trust in the Constitution. I urge you to pass this bill immediately.
    Sincerely, "
    >Vote For Pass Bill</a>
